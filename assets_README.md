# Doodles Assets for Bloom

This folder contains the official Doodles art assetsâ€”sprites, backgrounds, charactersâ€”that have been gently remixed and integrated into **Bloom**, a meditative flower-growing game made for the Doodles Jam.

ðŸŒ¸ **Use with Care**  
These assets are provided as part of the Doodles Jam event. In Bloom, theyâ€™re reimagined as a playful altar: each image a seed for joy, grief, and collective tending.

ðŸŒ¸ **Attribution**  
- Original assets: Official Doodles art pack (2025)
- Remix & integration: haz torres (https://github.com/haz-t)

ðŸŒ¸ **Guidelines for Use**  
- Respect the official Doodles licensing and remix guidelines.
- Use them only in alignment with the spirit of radical care and ceremonial play.
- No commercial redistribution or modification for profit.

ðŸŒ¸ **How Bloom Uses Them**  
- Pastel flowers for daily blooming rituals  
- Gentle backgrounds for meditative tending  
- Doodles characters as playful garden spirits

ðŸŒ± Let each asset you touch be a prayer, a possibility, a small offering to the collective.
